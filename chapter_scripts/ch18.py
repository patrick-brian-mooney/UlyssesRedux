"""Script to create the text generated based on the eighteenth chapter of
Joyce's Ulysses, 'Penelope.' Currently, just generates 9 sentences based on
the text of 'Penelope', aiming for an average paragraph length of 1.222, which
is the actual number of sentences and average paragraph length from that
chapter.

A Markov length of 3 seems to work well here, according to insufficient tests
evaluated informally.
